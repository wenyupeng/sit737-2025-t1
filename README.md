# How to run the code?
To run the code, you need to install node.js and npm. Then, you can run the following commands in the terminal:

fisrt, cd into the project directory:
```bash
cd 2.1P
```

Then, install the dependencies and start the development server:
```
npm install
npm dev
```
This will install the dependencies and start the development server. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app running.

> if you get an error like `Cannot find module 'nodemon'`, you can install it by running `npm install -g nodemon` in the terminal.
